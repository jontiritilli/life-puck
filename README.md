# GamePuck Project

GamePuck is a digital life counter and utility for tabletop and TCG games, designed for the [Waveshare ESP32-S3 1.85inch Round Display](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-lcd-1.85.htm) board. It features a 1.85" LCD screen with capacitive touch.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, intuitive, and visually appealing life counter for Flesh and Blood, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, and others. It supports both single-player and two-player modes, with customizable settings, additional modes quick reset options, and a robust history.

If you have a capable 3D printer, you can also print a case for the device. The case is designed to be compact and portable, making it easy to carry around. It also fits the Waveshare ESP32-S3 board and the battery snugly, providing protection and a professional look.

## 3D Printed Case

The case was designed by someone else. I remixed it and modified it (within the license parameters) to be more fitting for this use case. You can find the design files here: [Game Puck Case](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1635526-game-puck#profileId-1727766)
